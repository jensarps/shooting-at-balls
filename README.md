#About

This is the experiment/project I often use myself as testing ground, and I decided to put
it online.

Oh, and it's a WebGL shooter style game that uses a whole lot of HTML5 APIs.

Come on, shoot at balls right now over here: [http://jensarps.github.com/shooting-at-balls](http://jensarps.github.com/shooting-at-balls)

#Credits

This experiment uses [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), [game-shim](https://github.com/toji/game-shim), [requirejs](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs) and [decoupled-input](https://github.com/jensarps/decoupled-input).

It is an offspring of the [Ascent](https://github.com/jensarps/Ascent) Project, but it also features elements not present
in Ascent, such as InfiniteGround, the WebAudio API or PageVisibility API.

The background music is a song called "WipEout (Soundtrack Prototype for an abandoned fan game)"
by "[Flex Blur](http://www.myspace.com/flexblur)" and licensed under
